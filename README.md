# EV3-NXT-Color-Block

In LEGO® MINDSTORMS® EV3-G, We can use Color Sensor Block to control NXT Color Sensor,but it seems like not so well..
So we made this Block to add support for turning on the Blue and Green LEDs on the NXT color sensor, also we added Raw Mode, it's very useful tools.
Some data You can find in LabVIEW®. 

This Block made By OFDL Taiwan. Any Question? Please contact us OFDL Facebook Page 

Note：This Block should work with EV3 Firmware versions from v1.06 onwards (include Home, Education, Developer and LabVIEW® ver.). 
It is recommended that the EV3 Firmware is always updated to the latest version released from LEGO®. 
NXT Color Sensor Block is not officially supported by the LEGO® Group.
